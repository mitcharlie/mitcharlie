# Copilot Instructions for mitcharlie/mitcharlie

## Project Overview

This repository focuses on simulating aspects of ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) and thermodynamics.

Key files:
- `README.md`: Basic project description mentioning focus on ACPI and thermodynamics simulator.
- `general Vender.txt`: Contains a link to General Electric (GE), possibly vendor-related information.
- `test.txt`: Test file with edit timestamps from mobile and desktop.
- `Screenshot_20260116_013132.jpg`: Screenshot file, likely project-related.
- `.github/DOC/SimulatorVender/`: Intended directory for simulator code (currently empty).

## Architecture

No major components defined yet. The project is in early development. Simulator code is planned to be organized under `.github/DOC/SimulatorVender/`.

## Developer Workflows

- No specific build, test, or debug commands established.
- Use standard version control with Git.

## Conventions and Patterns

- No project-specific conventions yet. Follow general best practices for the target language (e.g., Python for simulations).

## Integration Points

- No external dependencies or integrations configured.

This is a starting point; expand as the codebase grows.
